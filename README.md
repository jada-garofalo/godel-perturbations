# Perturbations in the Gödel metric
This is a repository for hosting public access to Mathematica notebooks related to my work with perturbations in the Gödel metric.

This is still very much a work in progress, so expect updates as they become relevant!

p.s. text editors load .nb files in a very unpleasent way (as you can see if you click into any of the files here), so if you want to play around with this code, please download it and open it directly through the Mathematica client ;)

## The Gödel metric
The Gödel metric is an exact solution to Einstein's field equations in general relativity. Please visit this link for more information on this metric: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del_metric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del_metric)

## Required packages
This code uses the xAct library and its associated packages (i.e. xCoba, xPert, etc.) to handle very involved calculations with tensors.

Please visit this link to find the download files and instructions for this very helpful family of packages: [http://www.xact.es/index.html](http://www.xact.es/index.html)
