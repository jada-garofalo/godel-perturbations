# Perturbations in the Gödel metric
Repository for hostong public access to Mathematica notebooks related to my work with perturbations in the Gödel metric.

This is still very much a work in progress, so expect updates as they become relevant!

p.s. text editors load .nb files in a very unpleasent way (as you can see if you click into any of the files here), so if you want to play around with this code, please download it and open it directly through the Mathematica client ;)
